# dotnet_numbers coding challenge

Complete the 'GetDuplicates' method to return only the numbers that are duplicated in the given collection.

For the list `7, 2, 7, 7, 9, 5, 2` we would expect an output similar to "7, 2".

## Completing the challenge

There is no "right answer".
This challenge is a chance to explore different approaches to array processing using a variety of C# language features.

Tips:
- foreach loops, linq methods and IEnumerable behaviours are all fair game
- focus on a working solution, do not worry about premature optimisation
- work through the problem using pseudocode to help articulate your solution
